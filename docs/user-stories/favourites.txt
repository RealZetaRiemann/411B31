Favorite Recipes:
As a user, I want to be able to track my favorite recipes. While logged into my account, I will be able to 
go to a specific tab in the application and view previously saved favorite orders. I can scroll through my 
previously saved ones and select certain recipes. I will be able to see other recipes and the date and weather 
condition in which it was suggested to me.
