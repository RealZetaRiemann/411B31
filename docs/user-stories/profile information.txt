Profile Information:
As a logged in user I want to be able to go to my profile page so that I can access my profile information. 
As a user on my profile page, I want to be able to view the GitHub information associated with my account. 
After clicking on the profile page, I see my GitHub avatar, real name, and username, as well as my current zipcode.
I will also want to be able to change my zip code if necessary. To do this I can enter a new zipcode on the Zipcode page, and re-enter my zipcode.
