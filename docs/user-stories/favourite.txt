Favorite Recipe:
As a user, I want to be able to track my favorite recipe. While logged into my account, I will be able to 
go to a specific tab in the application and view previously saved favorite recipe. As a user, I want to
change my favorite recipe. After I get my new recipe of the day, I click the favorite button and it will
update my favorite recipe. I can go to the favorite recipe page and view my new favorite recipe.
