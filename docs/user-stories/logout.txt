Log-Out:
As a logged in user I want to be able to log out of my profile so that I can keep my information secure. 
I click on the profile button and choose to logout. After I log out, I am taken 
to the Weather Spoons landing page. If I realized I wanted to find another recipe, 
I click on the login button again so I can go back to finding more recipes.
