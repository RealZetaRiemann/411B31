Log-Out:
As a logged in user I want to be able to log out of my profile so that I can keep my information secure. 
As a logged in user, I want to be able to log out of my account and it will take me back to the Weather Spoons
landing page. I click on the configure profile button and choose to logout. After I log out, I am taken 
to the logout page that tells me I have successfully logged out. If I realized I wanted to find another recipe, 
I click on the login button again so I can go back to finding more recipes.
